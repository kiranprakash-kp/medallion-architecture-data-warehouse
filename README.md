# Modern Data Warehouse with Medallion Architecture and Advanced Analytics Pipeline using SQL

This project presents a modular, end-to-end data solution designed around the Medallion Architecture. It leverages SQL-based tools for data ingestion, exploration, transformation, and advanced analytics. The project is split across three dedicated repositories:

---

### üìÇ Project Components

1. **[SQL Data Warehouse Project](https://github.com/kiranprakash-kp/sql-data-warehouse-project)**  
   Implements the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) using SQL. Covers schema design, ETL logic, and layered data modeling for scalable analytics.

2. **[Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)](https://github.com/kiranprakash-kp/exploratory-data-analysis-sql)**  
   Initial data profiling and cleaning using SQL queries. Includes distribution checks, null analysis, outlier detection, and summary statistics.

3. **[Advanced Data Analytics Project (SQL)](https://github.com/kiranprakash-kp/advanced-data-analytics-project-sql)**  
   Performs advanced SQL analyses such as segmentation, trend analysis, cumulative metrics, part-to-whole ratios, and performance reporting.
